## 📋 DIRECTORY STRUCTURE AFTER UPLOAD

Your public_html/ folder should look like:

```
public_html/
├── index.html                    ← Main file
├── favicon.ico
├── manifest.json
├── .htaccess                     ← CRITICAL
├── .env.production               ← CRITICAL (or set in control panel)
├── sw.js                         ← Service Worker
│
└── assets/                       ← All JavaScript/CSS
    ├── index-2593d333.js         (main bundle)
    ├── index-2e3962b3.css        (styles)
    └── [other chunks]
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### #1: .htaccess File ⭐⭐⭐
**Purpose**: Makes React Router work on server
**Content**: Use template from .htaccess-template
**Location**: public_html/ (root, same level as index.html)
**Name**: Must be exactly ".htaccess" (not .htaccess.txt)

If missing → Routes will return 404 errors

### #2: Environment Variables ⭐⭐⭐
**Required Variables**:
- VITE_SUPABASE_URL
- VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY

**Where to Set**:
- Option A: Hostinger Dashboard → Environment Variables (RECOMMENDED)
- Option B: .env.production file in public_html/ root

If missing → Blank page (Auth context initialization fails)

### #3: dist/ Folder (Complete) ⭐⭐
**Must include all files and folders**:
- index.html
- assets/ (with all JS/CSS files)
- manifest.json
- favicon.ico
- Any other files generated by build

If incomplete → Missing CSS/JS → Page breaks

## 🚀 UPLOAD PROCEDURES

### Procedure A: Using ZIP Upload (Recommended for speed)

```
1. On your computer, compress dist/ folder
2. Name it: dist.zip
3. Hostinger File Manager:
   a. Navigate to public_html/
   b. Upload dist.zip
   c. Right-click → Extract
   d. Delete dist.zip
   e. Move contents of dist/ folder to public_html/ root
   f. Delete empty dist/ folder
4. Upload .htaccess
5. Upload .env.production (or set variables in control panel)
6. Upload sw.js from public/ folder
```

### Procedure B: Direct File Upload (Slower but direct)

```
1. Hostinger File Manager → public_html/
2. Upload index.html
3. Upload manifest.json
4. Upload favicon.ico
5. Create assets/ folder
6. Upload all files from dist/assets/ to assets/ folder
7. Upload .htaccess
8. Upload .env.production
9. Upload sw.js
```

## ✅ VERIFICATION AFTER UPLOAD

Check in File Manager:

```
public_html/
├── index.html                    ✓ Present
├── assets/
│   ├── index-*.js                ✓ Present
│   └── index-*.css               ✓ Present
├── .htaccess                     ✓ Present
├── .env.production               ✓ Present (or in control panel)
├── sw.js                         ✓ Present
└── manifest.json                 ✓ Present
```

---

## 🔍 WHAT NOT TO UPLOAD

❌ Do NOT upload:
- node_modules/ folder
- .git/ folder
- .env (development env file)
- src/ folder (source code)
- vite.config.js (not needed in production)
- package.json (not needed in production)
- TypeScript files (.ts, .tsx)
- Source maps (.js.map files) - unless you want them for debugging

These are NOT needed in production and waste space.

---

## 📦 FILE SIZE REFERENCE

```
Total Upload Size: ~500 MB (if including all asset variations)

Typical Sizes:
├── index.html: 6.27 kB
├── main JS bundle: 397.17 kB (gzip)
├── CSS: 11.40 kB (gzip)
└── Assets (images, etc): Variable

Gzipped total: ~410 kB (very small!)
```

---

## ⏱️ DEPLOYMENT TIME ESTIMATE

- **Upload via Hostinger FTP**: 2-5 minutes (depending on speed)
- **File extraction/setup**: 1-2 minutes
- **Environment variable configuration**: 1 minute
- **Testing deployment**: 2-5 minutes
- **Total**: ~10-15 minutes

---

## 🆘 IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

### Can't Extract ZIP?
- File manager supports ZIP extraction
- Largest file (JS bundle ~1.4 MB) should extract fine
- Try uploading files directly instead

### Can't Create .htaccess?
- Use File Manager "Create New File" option
- Name it ".htaccess" (exactly)
- Paste content from .htaccess-template

### Can't Set Environment Variables?
- Check Hostinger dashboard for Environment Variables section
- Or create .env.production file in File Manager
- Paste content from .env.production-template
- Add YOUR actual Supabase/Stripe keys

### Files Uploaded but Blank Page?
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Most likely: Missing environment variables
- Second most likely: .htaccess issue
- See DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST_2025.md for detailed troubleshooting

## 📞 FILE CHECKLIST BEFORE UPLOADING

Print this and check each item:

```
☐ dist/ folder exists locally with all files
☐ .htaccess-template reviewed and ready
☐ .env.production-template reviewed
☐ Supabase URL obtained from Supabase dashboard
☐ Supabase Anon Key obtained from Supabase dashboard
☐ Stripe public key obtained from Stripe dashboard
☐ HTTPS enabled on Hostinger
☐ File Manager access verified
☐ Current public_html/ backed up (optional but recommended)
☐ Ready to upload
```

## 🎯 QUICK UPLOAD COMMAND (FTP)

If you use FTP client instead of Hostinger File Manager:

```bash
# Upload entire dist/ folder to public_html/
ftp -u ftp://username:password@sarassure.com /dist/*

# Upload .htaccess
ftp -u ftp://username:password@sarassure.com /.htaccess

# Upload .env.production
ftp -u ftp://username:password@sarassure.com /.env.production

# Upload sw.js
ftp -u ftp://username:password@sarassure.com /public/sw.js
```
